# Session Summary: 2025-08-06 Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation & Configuration) of the AUI project, implementing configuration management and SQLite storage layer with full test coverage. Also established rebase merge workflow for maintaining linear git history.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Merged feature/cli-entry-point to main using fast-forward merge (46358a0)
- [x] Created phase-1-configuration-storage branch
- [x] Implemented configuration management with YAML and environment variables
- [x] Implemented SQLite storage layer with CRUD operations
- [x] Updated domain models to include IDs and persistence fields
- [x] Integrated config and storage into CLI entry point
- [x] Added Config tab to TUI displaying current configuration
- [x] Documented rebase merge preference in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Merged Phase 1 to main using fast-forward merge (6645b5e)

## Changes Made
### Files Created
- `internal/config/config.go`: Configuration management with YAML/env support
- `internal/config/config_test.go`: Comprehensive config tests
- `internal/storage/sqlite.go`: SQLite storage implementation
- `internal/storage/sqlite_test.go`: Storage layer tests

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added rebase merge documentation
- `cmd/aui/main.go`: Integrated config loading and storage initialization
- `internal/agent/agent.go`: Added ID, Provider fields and generateID()
- `internal/agent/agent_test.go`: Updated tests for new agent signature
- `internal/context/context.go`: Added ID field and generateID()
- `internal/context/context_test.go`: Updated tests for new context structure
- `internal/context/file.go`: Added ID, Name, Content fields, renamed TokenCount→Tokens
- `internal/context/file_test.go`: Updated tests for new file structure
- `internal/ui/app.go`: Added Config, Store fields and InitialAppWithDependencies()
- `internal/ui/app_test.go`: Updated tests for new AddAgent signature
- `go.mod`, `go.sum`: Added yaml.v3 and go-sqlite3 dependencies

## Tests Added/Modified
- Config tests: Load, Save, Validate, Environment overrides
- Storage tests: CRUD operations for agents/contexts, transactions, migrations
- Updated all existing tests to work with new ID fields and signatures

## Current State
- Phase: Phase 1 Complete (ready for Phase 2: Enhanced TUI & File Management)
- Branch: main
- Tests: All passing
- Coverage:
  - agent: 100.0%
  - config: 56.8% 
  - context: 98.3%
  - storage: 86.5%
  - ui: 64.7%
- Binary: Builds and runs successfully with config/storage support
- Repository: Local ahead of origin by 3 commits

## Next Session Recommendations
1. Push changes to origin (3 commits pending)
2. Start Phase 2: Enhanced TUI & File Management
   - File browser component with directory navigation
   - File content preview with syntax highlighting
   - Enhanced styling with lipgloss/bubbles
   - File system watching for changes
3. Consider adding Makefile for common commands
4. Consider setting up GitHub Actions CI

## Key Technical Decisions
- Used fast-forward merges to maintain linear git history
- SQLite for embedded persistence (no external DB needed)
- Configuration hierarchy: defaults → file → environment
- IDs generated using crypto/rand for uniqueness
- Separation of concerns: config, storage, and UI are independent

## Commit History

6645b5e feat(phase-1): implement configuration and storage layer
46358a0 docs: add session summary for initial setup

## Notes
- All Phase 1 objectives from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md achieved
- Configuration loads from `~/.config/aui/config.yaml` with env overrides
- Database stored at configured path (default: `~/.config/aui/aui.db`)
- API keys are masked in the UI for security
- Ready to build advanced TUI features in Phase 2
